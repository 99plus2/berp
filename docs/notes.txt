Random thoughts whilst implementing berp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interesting point about closure in Python:

   def f(x):
      def g():
         if True:
            return x
         else:
            return y 
      return g()
   print(f(3)) 

Note in the above program that g() refers to the free variable
y which is not defined anywhere in the program. Since the if
branch always is True, it never looks at y, and there is no
corresponding error in the program. So the potential error
is delayed until if and when the free variable is needed.

Note: such variables are treated as "globals".

If we switch the sense of the conditional like so, the
error is raised (of course):

   def f(x):
      def g():
         if False:
            return x
         else:
            return y
      return g()
   print(f(3))

Note: procedures are closed over their global environment.

The library StringTable.Atom looks like it might be useful for
implementing string lookups.

Compile for loops by desugaring into while loops.

   for vars in exp:
      suite1
   else:
      suite2

desugar to --->

   fresh_var_1 = exp.__iter__()
   fresh_var_2 = True
   while fresh_var_2:
      try:
         vars = fresh_var_1.__next__()
         suite1
      except StopIteration: 
         fresh_var_2 = False 
   else:
      suite2

Note: the fresh_var_2 variable is used to break the loop instead of using a break statement
because of the way that Python treats "else" blocks in while loops. The else block
is only executed if the while loop terminates normally (not via break). (Yes it is
weird). This transformation should handle break and continue correctly when they appear
inside suite1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling variables.

Ideally we would compile Python variables into Haskell variables. But Python
variables can be updated inside loops and closures, whereas Haskell variables
cannot. The next best thing is to use IORefs. A promising scheme is to 
compile each Python variable into a Haskell variable bound to an IORef. A read
from a Python variable becomes a readIORef, likewise writeIORef.

A few problems still remain. Python's scoping rules are slightly different to
Haskell. 

Nested references to variables can be annotated as "global" and "nonlocal", otherwise
a nested assignment creates a new local variable. The main issue is that Python
variable binding sites are potentially ambiguous (there is no separate syntax
to introduce a new variable - assignment is used, but this is problematic when
another variable of the same name is already in scope).

Here is an example:

x = 12
def f():
   x = 144
   def g():
     global x
     x = 42
   g()
f()
print(x)

This prints 42. If you remove the "global x" then the program prints 12. 
Note that the "global x" causes the innermost x to refer to the outermost x, thus
skipping the one in the middle. Haskell's nested scoping does not have an
equivalent way to skip enclosing scope.

One possible way to avoid this is to rename global variables, in psuedo
compiled haskell:

global_x = newVariable "x" 
writeIORef global_x 12
f = def (\[] -> do
   x = newVariable "x"
   writeIORef x 144 
   g = def (\[] -> do
     writeIORef global_x 42
     )
   g @@ []
   )
f @@ []
print @@ [global_x]

This looks good but has problems with "nonlocal".
Dictionary lookups on strings.
-------------------------------

For better performance of dictionary lookups on Strings we
could provide an interface which accepts a "hashed String":

   type HashedString = (Int, String)

   stringLookup :: HashedString -> HashTable -> IO (Maybe Object)
   stringLookup (hashValue, str) hashTable = do
      table <- liftIO $ readIORef hashTable
      case IntMap.lookup hashValue table of
         Nothing -> return Nothing
         Just matches -> return $ linearSearchString str matches

   linearSearchString :: String -> [(Object, Object)] -> Maybe Object
   linearSearchString _ [] = Nothing
   linearSearchString str ((key,value):rest)
      | objectEqualityString str key = Just value
      | otherwise = linearSearch str rest

   objectEqualityString :: String -> Object -> Bool
   objectEqualityString str1 (String { object_string = str2 }) = str1 == str2
   objectEqualityString _ _ = False

Also we can use Template Haskell to generate the Hashed Strings at compile time:

   hASHSTR :: String -> HashedString
   hASHSTR str = (hashString str, str)

And use it like so:

   stringLookup $(hASHSTR "foo") table

This should ensure that the string "foo" is hashed at compile time, not at runtime.

Might also want to support a string interface for the other hash table operations.
